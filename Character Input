Question :

Python provides built-in functions to perform input and output tasks.

Two commonly used functions for I/O (Input/Output) are input() and print().

Write a program to get a character as input and print it.

The input() function reads input from the keyboard. When the user enters a character, it is stored in the variable test_character.

In Python, there is no need for a format specifier like %c; the input() function automatically reads input as a string.

Sample Input:

z

Sample Output:

z

Answer : test_character=input("Enter the character: ")
         print(test_character)

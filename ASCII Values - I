Question :
ASCII - American Standard Code for Information Interchange.

Write a program to get a character as input and print its ASCII value.

When a character is entered, the character itself is not stored as a number. Instead, we can retrieve its ASCII value using the ord() function.

Unlike C, Python does not use format specifiers like %c to display characters; instead, we can directly print the character and its ASCII value.

Sample Input :

g

Sample Output:

103

Code :
test_ascii=input("Enter the char: ")
print(ord(test_ascii))

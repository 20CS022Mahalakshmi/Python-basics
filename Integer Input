Question :

Python provides built-in functions to perform input and output tasks.

Two commonly used functions for I/O (Input/Output) are input() and print().

Write a program to get an integer as input and print it.

The input() function reads input from the keyboard. When the user enters an integer, it is stored in the variable test_integer.

In Python, the int() function is used to convert the input string to an integer. Unlike C or Java, Python does not use format specifiers like %d; instead, values are printed directly using print().

Sample Input:

56

Sample Output:

56

Answer : test_integer=int(input("Enter the number: "))
         print(test_integer)

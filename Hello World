Question :
There are a few escape sequences used for formatting output in Python. You have to use the \t escape sequence to provide 4 to 5 spaces between words in the output console.

Enter the escape sequence directly into the print() statement within the inverted commas ("mes\tsage").

Sample Output:
Hello World Hello World


Code :
print("Hello World\tHello World")

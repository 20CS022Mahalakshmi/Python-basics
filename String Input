Question :
Python provides built-in functions to perform input and output tasks.

Two commonly used functions for I/O (Input/Output) are input() and print().

Write a program to get a string as input and print it.

The input() function reads input from the keyboard. When the user enters a string, it is stored in the variable test_string.

Unlike C, Python does not require a format string like %s since strings are handled as objects.

There is no need for an address operator (&) as Python automatically manages memory.

Sample Input - 1:

Programmer

Sample Output - 1:

Programmer


Sample Input - 2:

897

Sample Output - 2:

897

Code :
test_string=input("Enter the string: ")
print(test_string)
